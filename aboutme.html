            <span> A little more about me</span><br>
            I enjoy working with various tools and programming languages. I was introduced to computers at a very young age and fondly remember my childhood days when I was about 6-7 years old. I was in love with animations, and Big Hero 6 was my favourite cartoon, which I would watch a thousand times! I started off by creating flip books of Baymax, and as my curiosity grew about how animation works, I hopped onto my mom's computer, got into Microsoft PowerPoint, and fell in love with making frame by frame animations. Since then, I think that's where my main passion for computers started, as my mom also comes from an IT background. In game development, creating good art is crucial. I use software like Aseprite and Adobe Photoshop to make pixel art. I have about 4 months of experience with Aseprite and Pixel Art in general, and I've been using Photoshop since 2020 for creating YouTube thumbnails.
            
            <br><br>I used to be a gaming addict, spending 10–13 hours a day on games while also making gaming content. Although about 3 years ago I stopped gaming, I realised it doesn't give me purpose to pursue. I still play games, obviously, but I lost a lot of interest in going back on my Xbox or Nintendo Switch, so I ended up selling all my gaming consoles. I stopped that to focus on my golfing career and played competitively. Recently, I shifted my focus back to game development using game engines. I've worked with Scratch and Gamefroot in the past, and in the last 5 months, I created two games using Godot. The first was a learning project called "Cat Golf Platformer," and the second, "Lost Howls," was made for a national school game jam.
             
            <br><br>For web development, I started of from the ground up, I learnt WordPress when I was 10 years old, it was a good platform to get familiar with UI/UX design from wireframing a well structuted website to a finished product. Recently I focused on both front-end and back-end skills, using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I'm always learning new things to improve my work. Currently, I’m studying full-stack development with the MERN stack (React, MongoDB, Express, Node) because I plan to build a commercial project before I graduate from high school!
